# Comments:
### From a lady in PPM at Heinz:
The colors are too many to show clear components. Or, You shouldn't use color differentiation at all.
The scale should be light grey or line of dashes.
Good presentation of showing overal changes.
### From a gentleman at Heinz:
I see sharp comparison by period and also the changes of proportions inside each period.
Maybe you should add a label on this graph since it includes data in different values.
I can interpret this visualization with ease.

# Evaluation:
### For the original and what I am going to do:
What stood out? The overall changes on inflation rate./// What I found worked well: the curve leading the changing rates./// What didn't: however the curve itself hides some elements of monthly columns; the coloring isn't explicit; scaling of y-axis is too small and compressed/// I would stretch the width of picture first, currently it is too stressful. Second, I would adjust the color pattern to enhance constrast in categories. Use another color for the leading curve.
### Depiction of my work:
Since there are a lot of bars embedded inside the main index(The overall inflation rate) and that many of them are just small values showing less comparision by month with the BIG column. Therefore, I try to make clear contrast this time to show some significant elements that change together with the overal index, which can display synchronousness of two indexes.
