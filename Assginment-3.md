# Comments:
### From a lady in PPM at Heinz:
The colors are too many to show clear components. Or, You shouldn't use color differentiation at all.
The scale should be light grey or line of dashes.
Good presentation of showing overal changes.
### From a gentleman at Heinz:
I see sharp comparison by period and also the changes of proportions inside each period.
Maybe you should add a label on this graph since it includes data in different values.
I can interpret this visualization with ease.
